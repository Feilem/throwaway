Before you take the course, we expect that you have had some introduction to modeling in a lecture. For students who have not yet had such an introduction, we have recorded some of our own preceding lectures. Students who have no background in cognitive modeling and who did not take the course "Methods in AI research" can watch two classes. These are recordings from the Methods in AI Research course in the year 2017-2018:

* Lecture 1 --> this is the most critical class to watch before you start the course (Chris Janssen)

* Lecture 4  --> this class covers cognitive models for language (Frans Adriaans)

The PDFs of these classes are attached to this Blackboard item (note that some also contain links to video clips, which are useful to watch online).

In addition, you can watch the recordings on lecture net. Unfortunately, for the first lecture you can only see part of the slides (after the break).

To watch the recordings:
    1.    Go to: https://lecturenet.sites.uu.nl/en/finding-web-lectures/
    2.    Use the menu to go to "Finding web lectures" (Dutch: "weblectures zoeken")
    3.    Log-in using your student ID when requested.
    4.    Search for "Chris Janssen". You will find links to recordings from Methods in AI Research.
    5.    Make sure to watch the most recent recordings (2017) -- there are also recordings from previous year(s).
You only need to watch class 1 and class 4. The other classes cover other non-modeling content.



If you speak Dutch, instead of class 1 you can also watch this video from studium generale that Chris gave in 2017:
